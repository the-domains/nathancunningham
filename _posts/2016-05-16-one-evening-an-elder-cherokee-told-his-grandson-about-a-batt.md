description: 'One evening an elder Cherokee told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside all people. He said, "My son, the battle is between two wolves inside us. One is Fear. It carries anxiety, concern, uncertainty, hesitancy, indecision, and inaction. The other is Faith. It brings calm, conviction, confidence, enthusiasm, decisiveness, excitement, and action." The grandson thought for a moment then meekly asked his grandfather: "Which wolf wins?" The old Cherokee replied, "The one you feed."'
