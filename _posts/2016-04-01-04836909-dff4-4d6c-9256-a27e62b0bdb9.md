Lately I've been thinking a lot about the value of time.

One of the psalmists of ancient Israel prays that God would "teach us to number our days". Regardless of your world-view, the practice of numbering your days --- for me today is 16,256 --- can be a very powerful and humbling thing.

Do we view our time a limited asset?

Do we view it as our most precious asset?

Do we give as much thought to time management as to asset, wealth, or project management?

What would change if we did?

Here is an interesting exercise:   
1\. Go here: [http://korn19.ch/coding/days/en][0], plug in your birthday and figure out the number of your days / how many days old you are.

2\. Estimate how long you'll live and then multiply that by 365 and subtract the number of days you have left --- if all goes well.\*

If I use the average age of my grandfathers and assume that I'm relatively productive till my end of days, I have around 13,000 days left to work with.

So this means I'm well into the 3rd quarter.

While sobering, it's also empowering to think about this because it helps me remember that I only have today, this day.

It helps develop a healthy and proper sense of urgency.

So seize this day and make it count. And the next and the next...

What outcome can we expect?

If that psalmist was right --- and I think he is --- we can expect to gain a heart of wisdom. If you've read this far, maybe you took a big step in that direction.
