I'm in progress and I start over a lot, but always seek to build in new learning each time.

I'm Nathan Cunningham.   
I build networks that empower people to overcome barriers.

Welcome to my Progress Report. This is my digital home base. 

I held off developing my plot in cyberspace until 2016\. Why? Because I don't have time to build my own website. But finally, over 25 years after enrolling and then immediately dropping out of Artificial Intelligence (AI) class in 1990, I'm finding that the AI is helpful. AI built this website.

This website was designed by thegrid.ai (in fact it's design is constantly being optimized as the AI gets smarter). I feed it content, it designs my site. Please be aware and forbearing with the fact that this technology is in beta. That said, I'm honored to be a founding member of [The Grid][0].

The purpose of this site (for now) as the name implies is to share reports of my progress along my journey in the form of things I'm writing or reading.

Thanks for stopping by!

_About this and most of the photography on this site. They were taken in East Lothian, west of Edinburgh, Scotland near my family home by our family friend and photographer: [Paul Smith][2]. This place in particular - Tantallon Castle with Bass Rock hold sacred significance for our family._
