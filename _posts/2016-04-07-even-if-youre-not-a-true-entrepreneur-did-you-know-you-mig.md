Even if you're not a true entrepreneur, did you know you might be an [intrapreneur][0]?

I've been thinking a lot about the topic of entrepreneurship lately.  
One of the things I've concluded is that I'm not an Entrepreneur. Yet.

But as early as I can remember I've always been entrepreneurial and enterprising and needing to adapt to change. So almost naturally, while working for mostly big companies for the last 30 years, I've always been on the hunt for problems to solve and new ways of getting things done.  

[Pinchot in 1984 defined intrapreneurs as "dreamers who do. Those who take hands-on responsibility for creating innovation of any kind, within a business". ][1]

So if you do that you're an intrapreneur and probably didn't even know it.
