# Steal My Ideas

If you see anything here of value and want to run with it for your own writing, speaking, consulting, projects, etc. these are partially formed ideas I'm collecting. You are welcome to them ... and make them better!

## for Future Posts here or Medium or LinkedIn

"In Chapter Two of _Tipping Point_, Gladwell describes three special types of people: **Connectors**: Mavens: and Salespeople." I'm more of the first two, but need to learn the third as arguable 3/4 of my time should be spend selling these days...

## for Future Blogs

www.dontskipthefineprint.com -- an idea to publish summaries for many of the T&Cs we routinely accept without actually reading. Would include some disclaimer that we can't be sued, but be a helpful synopsis of what we're really agreeing to with that new device or subscription or free social media account.

www.thedigitalhelp.com -- provide digital help to the masses, so they don't have to rely entirely on their nephews or strangers who want to charge them too much money to "take care" of their tech needs that could easily be explained and taught on this laypersons site for digital help.

## for Daily Routine

My routines are developing all the time, but I've found a need to re-calibrate recently due to massively changed circumstances.

[Some ideas I plan to implement from Tim Ferris][0] -  this he calls his "coping mechanism and 8-step process for maximizing efficacy (doing the right things):

1) Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. E-mail is the mind killer.

2) Make a cup of tea (I like pu-erh) and sit down with a pen/pencil and paper.

3) Write down the 3-5 things --- and no more --- that are making you most anxious or uncomfortable. They're often things that have been punted from one day's to-do list to the next, to the next, to the next, and so on. Most important usually = most uncomfortable, with some chance of rejection or conflict.

4) For each item, ask yourself:

**-- "If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?"**

undefinedundefined

5) Look only at the items you've answered "yes" to for at least one of these questions.

undefined

6) Block out at 2-3 hours to focus on ONE of them for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important stuff slide. It will still be there tomorrow.

undefined

7) TO BE CLEAR: Block out at 2-3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today. This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME. Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does not work.

undefined

8) If you get distracted or start procrastinating, don't freak out and downward spiral; just gently come back to your ONE to-do.

...

It doesn't take much to seem superhuman and appear "successful" to nearly everyone around you. In fact, you just need one rule: **What you do** is more important than **how you do** everything else, and doing something **well** does **not** make it **important**.

If you consistently feel the counterproductive need for volume and doing lots of _stuff_, put these on a Post-it note:

* Being busy is a form of laziness--lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.
* Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions.

And when --- despite your best efforts --- you feel like you're losing at the game of life, remember: Even the best of the best feel this way sometimes. When I'm in the pit of despair, I recall what iconic writer Kurt Vonnegut said about his process: "When I write, I feel like an armless, legless man with a crayon in his mouth."
